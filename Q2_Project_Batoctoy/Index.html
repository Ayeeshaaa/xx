        <p id='intro'>Introduction in Teenage Pregnancy</p>
        </header>

        <p>Inadequate sexual education perpetuates existing taboos and leads to probable impotence or lack of satisfaction, guilt complexes, and, in the absence of guidance, unexpected pregnancies and abortion. However, there are still some teenagers and adolescents that lack understanding in sexual education, 
            which can lead to them having one of the most common problem in teens: Teenage Pregnancy. </p>

        <p>Pregnancy between the ages of thirteen and nineteen is considered a teenage pregnancy. 
            Similarly, there are females as young as ten years old who are sexually active or are sexually abused. As expected, an unexpected pregnancy may happen and it would still be considered as adolescent pregnancy or teenage pregnancy.
