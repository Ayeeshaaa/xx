                <p>Sex is considered ‘bastos’ or taboo in most places. With this, adolescents either don’t take Sex Ed 
                    seriously, or refuse to learn about it. In some instances, when the topic is about Sex, some people seem 
                    to steer completely away from the topic because it feels ‘awkward’ or ‘bastos’. If this 
                    habit continues, teens and adolescents won’t be able to learn and continue to make mistakes. Furthermore, we will be talking
                    about teenage pregnancy: one of the most common problems in teens.</p>


                <p>Sexual intercourse, whether forced or consented, is a primary cause of Teen Pregnancy. 
                    Some people may say, “Ginusto mo yan!” and blame it all on the victim. Don’t be too quick to judge or 
                    assume that the teen is just ‘malandi’ or uneducated, because the cause of their pregnancy may not be because they
                    don't have knowledge about sex. Instances like this happen because they don't know when they are being sexually assaulted.
                     Thus, young children and teenagers should be taught the difference between sexual abuse and affection, 
                    as most of the time, they can’t differentiate it. </p>


                <p>Young people have the right to live healthy lives, and society has the obligation to prepare them 
                    by offering comprehensive sexual health education that equips them with the tools they need to make healthy choices.
                    Tools such as birth control pills and implants prevent unwanted pregnancies.</p>
